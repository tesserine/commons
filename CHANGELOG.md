## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Added ADR-0011 Ecosystem Release Identity and Ceremony, defining
  `commons` release manifests as the canonical multi-repo release identity,
  uniform lockstep tags across release-boundary repos, deployment-manifest
  alignment with published manifests, non-cargo version-of-record surfaces,
  and recovery rules for invalid published ecosystem releases.
- Added ADR-0010 Deployment Release Candidates and expanded `RELEASE.md` with
  the `vX.Y.Z-rc.N` convention for immutable deployment refs across cargo and
  non-cargo ecosystem repos.
- Added ADR-0009 Operator Metrics Convention, establishing separate
  loopback-default operator listeners, network placement as the metrics access
  boundary, Prometheus text exposition, ecosystem metric naming, and bounded
  label cardinality policy.
- Added ADR-0007 Day-One Stance, formalizing the default orientation
  toward foundational movability: artifacts are scaffolding for what
  comes next, proxies serve the foundation rather than replacing it,
  reversible decisions move at high velocity, and declarations of
  maturity are resisted.
- Added ADR-0008 Component Orthogonality in Session Composition,
  establishing clean boundaries for agentd-managed sessions: agentd
  composes the container runtime, runa owns `.runa/` content via
  `runa init`, and the agent declaration expresses operator intent
  declaratively. The `runa run --agent-command` override carries
  agentd's chosen command into runa without shell-script slots in
  declarative config.
- Added ADR-0006 Release Discipline and `RELEASE.md`, establishing
  `cargo-release` as the canonical release tool for Tesserine
  cargo-workspace repos and codifying the workspace-version
  invariant — the code at the tag self-reports the version the tag
  names. commons owns the convention; per-repo adoption (agentd,
  runa) is tracked separately.

## [0.1.1] — 2026-04-21

### Added

- Added `EXIT-CODES.md`, defining the shared session-outcome exit code
  convention for runners and callers, including survey findings, reserved
  POSIX ranges, caller/runner guidance, and forward-compatibility rules.
- Added `REQUEST.md` and `schemas/request/v1/request.schema.json` as the
  canonical request artifact spec (version `1.0.0`). REQUEST.md is the
  prose authority; the versioned JSON Schema is the machine-checkable
  realization.
- Added ADR-0005, formalizing commons as the spec authority for
  system-level cross-component artifact types: canonicalization criteria,
  the prose-plus-versioned-schema canonical form, semver rules across
  directory and full-version levels, immutable-reference requirements for
  conformance, methodology vendoring with provenance, and the runtime
  boundary (methodologies serve runtime; commons serves authoring).

### Changed

- Renamed repo identity from "governance" to "commons" in README. Updated
  all ecosystem repo links from pentaxis93 to tesserine org. Added base repo
  to the ecosystem listing.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-04-10

First release. Commons defines the shared principles and architectural
decisions that govern all Tesserine ecosystem components.

### Principles

- Seven bedrock principles organized as a topology: sovereignty, sequence,
  grounding, obligation to dissent, recursive improvement, transmission,
  verifiable completion.
- Sixteen engineering design principles governing how code decisions are made
  across the ecosystem: elimination over accommodation, fix at the source,
  honest naming, correctness over optimization, architecture as communication,
  review discipline, and others.

### Architectural decision records

- ADR-0001: Sovereignty — operator owns WHAT, runtime owns HOW.
- ADR-0002: Everything earns its place — no artifact or abstraction persists
  without demonstrated need.
- ADR-0003: Unconditional responsibility — every component owns its failure
  modes without blaming callers.
- ADR-0004: Compound improvement — every operation refines both the object
  and the process.
